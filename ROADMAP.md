# What's coming?
- Coditor will uses vuejs-templates/webpack (there are full features like hotreload, linting, testing, development mode, build assets ready for production. You can see all features [here](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack#whats-included))
- A extensive documentation to development new features, examples, and put on production.
- Making web request and handle response using vue-resource.
- Add dinamic tabs
- Select language dinamically for each tab

> Important: Coditor intented to be a independent webcomponent. The original idea is to be a multitab code editor, no more, no less.

If you have any idea to a new feature, I would be very interested in discussions. Meanwhile I will continue working in the coditor new version.
